# Izi Math

## Objective

Izi Math aims to introduce software programming concepts to primary grade learners using fun Math puzzles and problems. The real purpose is to introduce and integrate computational thinking (CT) into the curriculum. The goal is not to teach learners how to do Math; the goal is to inspire them to think like computer scientists.

## Implementation

We start small with a program that generates random arithmetic [equations](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/z83rkqt/articles/zv2ck2p). The learner specifies the type of Math question that they wish to attempt and the skill level.
