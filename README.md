# Izi Math

## Objective

Izi Math aims to introduce software programming concepts to primary grade learners using fun Math puzzles and problems. The real purpose is to introduce and integrate computational thinking (CT) into the curriculum. The goal is not to teach learners how to do Math; the goal is to inspire them to think like computer scientists.
